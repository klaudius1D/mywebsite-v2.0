# Food Service Website
This project is a web application built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It is a fictional food delivery company that provides healthy meals to foreign cities. This is based from a Udemy course I took called,

Lessons I learned throughout the project include the basic guidelines of web design. This involves typography, working with colors, images and icons. This also touched on proper spacing and layout techniques to produce professional-looking websites. This course was a good resource to deepen my knowledge to the best practices of writing HTML and CSS, it also introduced me to the jQuery library that we used to implement animations to our web application.
